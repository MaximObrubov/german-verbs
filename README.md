Some stuff about german verbs

## Plans
1. Create app to display and search verbs with prepositions
2. Find multiple content
3. Deploy site somewhere (maybe just simple on GH pagesJ)
4. Probably use [capacitor](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-convert-your-angular-application-to-a-native-mobile-app-android-and-ios-c212b38976df) to deploy app to mobile platforms 

Just a simple stuff to make learning german faster and funnier!
